# Movies-ETL

In this project, I used a process in data engineering known as Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) to move information into a comprehensive database I created from extracting data from an online source, Kaggle, transforming and cleaning that data up, and the loading it into a PostgreSQL database to more easily query and use. In this process I transformed a JSON file, renamed columns, dropped null values, changed data types, and even merged datasets from different sources using the join method. I finally loaded my transformed data into a PostgreSQL database to easily extract information about a myriad of movies. 

**Happy movie watching!**
